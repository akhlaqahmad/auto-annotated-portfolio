The Hong Leong Bank mobile app serves thousands of users daily, providing them with secure and efficient banking services. My role involved implementing new features, refining existing functionalities, and ensuring a smooth banking experience through Clean Swift architecture.

Working in an Agile environment, I collaborated closely with backend engineers, designers, and product managers to integrate robust security measures, enhance performance, and implement new digital banking capabilities. Whether it was troubleshooting critical bugs or optimizing UI/UX elements, my focus was always on delivering a reliable and user-friendly banking platform.
