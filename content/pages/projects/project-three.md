Developing FAYVO at ILSA Interactive was an exciting challenge. The platform aimed to bridge the gap between recommendations and social networking, enabling users to save and categorize their interests—be it books, movies, places, or fashion. My focus was on crafting a robust and scalable iOS application, implementing Clean Swift architecture to enhance maintainability and performance.

I worked closely with cross-functional teams to integrate third-party APIs, optimize backend communication, and ensure seamless data synchronization. User experience was a top priority, and I fine-tuned animations, navigation, and UI responsiveness to align with industry best practices.


> "Building software is not just about writing code; it's about creating seamless experiences that users love.”

From implementing real-time synchronization to handling complex data models, FAYVO was a test of both technical expertise and collaboration. The project involved frequent iterations based on user feedback, ensuring continuous improvements and a polished final product.

FAYVO demonstrated my ability to develop scalable iOS applications while collaborating in a dynamic and fast-paced environment. It remains one of the standout projects in my portfolio, reflecting my passion for building innovative mobile experiences.
