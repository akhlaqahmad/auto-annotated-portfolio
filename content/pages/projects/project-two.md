  Building a seamless and scalable iOS banking experience isn’t a solo act, but as a lead iOS developer, I played a key role in shaping the OCBC Business financial app. From fixing critical bugs to implementing new features and launching them in production, I ensured a smooth, efficient, and secure experience for business users.

The OCBC Business financial app is a vital tool for businesses managing their finances, and ensuring its reliability, security, and performance has been at the core of my role. As part of a cross-functional Agile team, I contributed to feature development, bug fixing, and optimizing app performance, always keeping scalability and maintainability in focus.

From integrating social logins to refining the app's architecture, my expertise in Clean Swift has allowed the team to build a structured, testable, and modular codebase. Working closely with designers, backend engineers, and product managers, I helped bridge the gap between business requirements and technical execution, delivering a smooth and intuitive user experience.

> "A great banking app should be invisible—effortless, seamless, and always reliable."”

Through continuous iteration, feedback loops, and adherence to best coding practices, I ensured that every release not only met functional requirements but also improved the overall stability and user experience. Whether implementing new API integrations or enhancing security protocols, my focus has always been on delivering a high-quality product that businesses can trust.

This project has reinforced my belief in collaboration, adaptability, and the importance of clean, scalable code in shaping impactful digital products.
